Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

sumPromise1 is added to the microqueue before sumPromise2. After the main thread is complete, the callbacks in the microqueue are executed.  
sumPromise1 outputs the 2 synchronous log statements, one before resolving and one after. Since the input is an array, it adds a callback via setTimeout to the event loop 
(pending callbacks). Since there's still a promise in the microqueue, sumPromise2 gets executed, outputting the first log statement. Since this promise's input is not
an array, an error is thrown (and logged), finally, the last message is logged. Since sumPromise2 threw an error, the catch block immediately executes, 
logging the error message. Finally, the event loop executes the callback added by sumPromise1 (logging the resolve message). This causes the then block to execute, 
logging the resulting value.
